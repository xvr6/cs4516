# Application Layer

> will be mostly a review, but there is a focus on mail services in this re-teaching

## SMTP - Application layer

uses TCP for transport layer

- User agents (UA)
  - outlook, gmail, etc
- Mail servers
  - mailbox - contains messages for user
  - message queue - of outgiong (to be sent) mail messages

1) allice uses her UA compose email message to 'bob@someserver.edu'
2) UA sends msg to mail server, message placed in queue
3) client side of SMTP opens TCP connection with bobs mail server
4) SMTP client sends alice's message over the TCP connection
5) bobs mail server places message in bobs mailbox
6) bob utilizes his UA to read msg

- with SMTP, you can pretend to be anyone else
  - recipient server does not do any authentication
  - can just use a ny email without ever logging into it
